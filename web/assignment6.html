    <p>Cricket is a sport that originated in England and is now played throughout the world, particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the British Isles.
         It is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. 
        The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 meters) by 10 feet (3.04 meters) wide.
         Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket. There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the ball away from the wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive.
