    <h1>Discipline</h1>
    <p>A discipline is an act of teaching people or self to obey rules and regulations suitable for a particular goal or objective. Routine acts in a timely manner can also be considered as a discipline. Waking up early every morning is an act of discipline; not speaking while eating is an act of discipline and never missing your classes is also an act of discipline.
        </p>

       <p> Discipline keeps a person in control and makes him/her more goals oriented and progressive. Moreover, a disciplined person can handle critical situations in a composed manner. He/she never disobey his/her elders and always behave in a polite manner. Discipline shapes the future of an individual. It makes life easy and brings success and respect from all the quarters.</p>
